  -	A simple calculator that supports:
    -	**(+)** Addition,
    -	**(–)** Subtraction,
    -	**(×)** Multiplication,
    -	**(÷)** Divison,
    -	**(√)** Square root,
    -	**(x²)** Power of 2,
    -	**(C)** All clear

#### It has the following extra functionality:
-	Text view for input operation

-	Negative values supported
-	Decimal input supported
-	*Some* error handling
